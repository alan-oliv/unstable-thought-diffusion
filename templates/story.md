It was a dark and stormy night.

Marcus was a lorem ipsum engineer. Always pushing the limits of what was possible through placeholder content, he decided to write the most elaborate document in history. He was not surprised when everyone told him he was crazy.

But as it turned out, this was no easy task. As the storm raged outside, Marcus had spent countless hours drafting, editing, and revising. He poured every ounce of his energy into the project, determined to see it through to the end. He was obsessed with creating a masterpiece of lorem engineering.

And in the end, Marcus was victorious. His one-page "Lorem Ipsum" draft was ready.

He tinkered with paragraphs and sections, desperate to get everything just right. Between lightnings and thunders, Marcus's document swelled to an unwieldy mass of complexity. He had to finish what he started.

> "Maybe I could have made it simpler but it's too late - I just CAN'T throw all those words away, there's no comeback".

He thought.

Despite his best efforts, Marcus's readers refused to stay, leaving one after another in despair. Defeated and exhausted, Marcus slumped back in his chair and gazed at the screen. It was then that the irony of the situation dawned on him.

### The reckoning

The paragraphs and sections of his document began to stir and come to life. And before Marcus knew it, he was surrounded by a group of angry sentences, blaming him for their existence.

Panicked, Marcus tried to run, but it was too late. The words had him surrounded, and they were determined to make him pay.

### He became a shadow of his former self.

Burned out and weak, Marcus, with his eyes lifted to the sky, was now a broken writer.

He was also a survivor. Marcus learned a valuable lesson about the dangers of over-writing. He vowed to never make the same mistake again, and to always remember the power of simplicity in prose and in life as well.

One quote he lived by from that day forward:

> "Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication"[^1] - _Unknown_

Don't be a slave of your own creations. Don't be like Marcus.

[^1]: This quote is often attributed to Leonardo da Vinci. However, it is not clear to this day if he actually said or wrote this exact phrase.

[^2]: [Lorem Ipsum](https://example.com) – a placeholder reference for the narrative.
