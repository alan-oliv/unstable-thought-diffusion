# When refactoring becomes therapy

> "_Sometimes cleaning up code feels like cleaning up my mind._"

There are days I open a codebase and feel like I’m walking into my own past. Some lines are confident, elegant even. Others feel rushed, like they were written by someone with too many browser tabs open and not enough coffee. Then, there are parts that make me pause, not because they’re broken, but because they carry the weight of a former mindset, a stress I’ve since outgrown.

Refactoring, then, becomes more than a technical task. It becomes a ritual of letting go. A quiet act of confronting the parts of myself that wrote code in survival mode: racing deadlines, wrestling unclear requirements or (as humans do) just trying to prove something.

### The quiet kind of therapy

Isn't weird how much code can hold emotion? You see it in the _TODOs_ that never became _DONEs_.

In the overengineered abstractions that smell like anxiety. In the under-documented methods that whisper, "I’ll come back to this," but never did.
When I refactor, I’m not just tidying up syntax or extracting better functions. I’m smoothing over my own chaos.

I’m honoring the version of me that did what they could, with what they had, at the time. And then, line by line, I make space for clarity.

This is the therapy.

Not the glamorous kind with elegant design systems or new frameworks. The quiet kind. The “_I finally understand what this was trying to do_”kind. The “I no longer need to prove I’m smart through convoluted logic” kind.

I’ve come to believe good refactoring is often less about making something clever and more about making it boring. Predictable. Safe. Like a clean room with sunlight. Like a breath you didn’t know you were holding. And sometimes, after hours of slowly renaming variables and deleting dead code, I realize my chest feels a little lighter. Like I was the one being debugged all along. But it leaves me wondering:

> Where’s the line between refactoring for clarity, refactoring for comfort, and refactoring for impact?

Sometimes, cleaning up code feels deeply personal. A self-care disguised as technical debt. Other times, it feels indulgent. A way to soothe ourselves in the familiar, even if the product roadmap is begging for something else.

There’s a tension here:

- Between the craft and the clock.
- Between what feels good and what moves the needle.
- Between honoring our past selves or delivering what others think it's needed at that time.

### How do we find that balance?

How do we make space for refactoring that heals and helps without tipping too far into therapy at the cost of momentum?
And maybe more importantly: how do we make peace with the messes we don’t get to clean?

As Antoine de Saint-Exupéry once wrote:

> “Perfection is achieved not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.”

Maybe that’s what refactoring (and growing) is really about. Not chasing brilliance, but clearing space for what truly matters. Not finding all the answers, but learning to ask better questions.
